you are drinking your coffee alone at a sidewalk cafe.
you are watching people around you, families, children playing, a young woman engrossed in a book, a lost tourist trying to find his way, a man in a hurry, running to catch his bus, the leaves of the cherry tree above your head.
you have no real reason to be there: you're not meeting anyone, and no one is waiting for you elsewhere.
you will stay as long as you like, and leave only when you're ready.
on a whim you can decide what to do and how to do it: there is something a bit dangerous and yet delicious about freedom.
you are anonymous in your own city; no one knows your age, who you are, or what you do for a living. In this moment, you can regain control of your life. feel the beating of your heart, take a deep breath, and listen to yourself. do nothing. absolutely nothing. savor these stolen moments. they help you regroup, and belong to no one else. you alone are responsible for what happens to you.
